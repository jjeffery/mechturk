/*
Package mechturk is a Go language SDK for the AWS Mechanical Turk web service.

The SDK is documented at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSMechTurk/latest/AWSMturkAPI.
To quote from the that website, Amazon Mechanical Turk is a web service that
provides an on-demand, scalable, human workforce to complete jobs that humans
can do better than computers, for example, recognizing objects in photos.

This package uses the SOAP API defined in WSDL. Some of the code has been
auto-generated from the WSDL, which is located in the wsdl subdirectory.
